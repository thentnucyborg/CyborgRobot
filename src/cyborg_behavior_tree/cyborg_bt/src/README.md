# README
This file works as information for the cyborg behaviour tree node. 

* `project.json` was created in 2018 by Morten Mjelva
* `johanne_bt_project.json`was created by Johanne Kalland in 2020

Both contain a behaviour tree created with behavior3py and behavior3editor. The file from 2020 is a proposal for a tree and was not fully implemented.

In `johanne_bt_project.json` it is assumed that sequence nodes read from top-to-bottom. Usually they are represented left-to-right, but the editor arranges them top-to-bottom.
