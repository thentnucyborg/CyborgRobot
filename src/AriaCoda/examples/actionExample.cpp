/**
@example actionExample.cpp  An example program demonstrating how to make and use new actions.

This example program creates two new actions, Go and Turn. Go will drive the robot forward safely,
while Turn will avoid obstacles detected by the sonar by turning. 
This program also adds a predefined
action from Aria which tries to recover from stalls (hit something and 
can't move forward) by backing and turning.

Each of these actions have the normal constructor and destructor, note that 
the constructors use constructor chaining to create their ArAction part
correctly.  Each action then also implements the essential virtual method, 
fire(). This fire function is called by the action resolver, and
returns values that, in combination with other actions' desired behavior,
determine the driving commands sent to the robot.

Also note that each of these actions override the setRobot function; these 
implementations obtain the sonar device from the robot in addition to doing the
needed caching of the robot pointer.  This is what you should do if you
care about the presence or absence of a particular sensor.  If you don't
care about any particular sensor you could just use one of the  checkRangeDevice...
methods in ArRobot (there are four of them).
Also note that these are very naive actions, they are simply an example
of how to use actions.

See the @ref actions Actions section of the Aria reference manual overview for more details about actions.

Note that actions must take a small amount of time to execute, to avoid
delaying the robot synchronization cycle.
