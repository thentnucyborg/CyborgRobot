/** Describes general properties of a figure to be drawn on screen.
 *  (The actual location/geometry data of the figure is stored elsewhere and may
 *  change frequently)
 *
 * The following shapes are currently recognized:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>"polyDots" - a set of small filled circles centered on each point.  Each 
 *                      ellipse is "size" mm in diameter.  (Example: laser) </li>
 *	   <li>"polyArrows" - a set of small arrows that terminate on each point and
 *	                    point towards the robot.
 *                      Each arrow is "size" mm in length. (Example: sonar) </li>
 *     <li>"polyLine" - a line through each of the points.  The line is "size" 
 *                      pixels wide.  (Example: path) </li>
 *     <li>"polyPoints" - a set of one pixel points.  (Example: localization)</li>
 *     <li>"polySegments" - a set of line segments.  For an array of n points,
 *                      n/2 segments are drawn.  Each segment is drawn from 
 *                      array[i] to array[i+1] (with i starting at 0).  The
 *                      segments are "size" pixels wide.  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The primary color determines what color the shape is. No shapes currently use
 * the secondary color (but future shapes may, or these shapes may be extended
 * in the future to use it).
 * 
 * The layer is an arbitrary int identifier that must be greater than 30 and 
 * less than 100.  (Layers below 30 are considered part of the map data, i.e.
 * not associated with a particular robot.)  The robot is drawn on layer 50.  
 * Any items that are to be drawn on top of the robot should have a layer 
 * number greater than 50.  By default, range devices begin on layer 70.
 *
 * The visibility attribute specifies 
 * whether the data is to be displayed by default, and whether the user is allowed
 * to change the display.  The following visibilities are currently supported:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> "AlwaysOn"   - item is always displayed </li>
 *  <li> "DefaultOn"  - item is visible by default, but the user may hide it</li>
 *  <li> "DefaultOff" - item is hidden by default but the user may show it </li>
 *  <li> "AlwaysOff"  - item is always hidden</li>
 * </ul>
 * The default visibility is "DefaultOn".
