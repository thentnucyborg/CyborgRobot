/** @brief Base class for actions
  
    @ref actions Actions are objects queried for desired behavior by
    ArActionResolver to determine robot movement commands.

    To implement an action object, define a subclass of ArAction,
    and implement the fire() method. You may also override
    setRobot() to obtain information from ArRobot, but you
    must also call ArAction::setRobot() so that the ArRobot pointer
    is stored by ArAction.

    Several predefined action objects are also included in ARIA,
    they are listed here as ArActions's subclasses.

    If an action is not active (it has been deactivated), then
    it will be ignored by the action resolver. 
    Actions may be grouped using ArActionGroup, and activated/deactivated as a
group. For example, the modes in demo.cpp and ArNetworking activate/deactivate action groups when switching modes.

      on the resolver's processing of previous, higher-priority actions.
      This is only for the purpose of giving information to the 
      action, changing it has no effect.
      @return pointer to what this action wants to do, NULL if it wants to do 
      nothing. Common practice is to keep an ArActionDesired
      object in your action subclass, and return a pointer to
      that object. This avoids the need to create 
      new objects during each invocation (which could never
      be deleted).
      Clear your stored ArActionDesired
      before modifying it with ArActionDesired::reset().
