/// Action to back up if short-range IR sensors trigger
/**
 * If the robot has front-mounted binary (triggered/not triggered) IR sensors, 
 * this action will respond to a sensor trigger by backing up and perhaps
 * turning, similar to bumpers.  This action assumes that if an IR triggers, the
 * robot caused it by moving forward into or under an obstacle, and backing up
 * is a good reaction.
