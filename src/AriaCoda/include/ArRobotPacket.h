   This class reimplements some of the buf operations since the robot is 
   opposeite endian from intel.  Also has the getID for convenience.  
   
   You can just look at the documentation for the ArBasePacket except for
   the 4 new functions here, verifyCheckSum, getID, print, and calcCheckSum.
