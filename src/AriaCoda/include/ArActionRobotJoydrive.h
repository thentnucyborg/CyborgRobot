class ArRobotPacket;

/// This action will use the joystick for input to drive the robot
/**
   This class creates its own ArJoyHandler to get input from the
   joystick.  Then it will scale the speed between 0 and the given max
   for velocity and turning, up and down on the joystick go
   forwards/backwards while right and left go right and left.  You
   must press in one of the two joystick buttons for the class to pay
   attention to the joystick.
   
   NOTE: The joystick does not save calibration information, so you
   must calibrate the joystick before each time you use it.  To do
   this, press the button for at least a half a second while the
   joystick is in the middle.  Then let go of the button and hold the
   joystick in the upper left for at least a half second and then in
   the lower right corner for at least a half second.
