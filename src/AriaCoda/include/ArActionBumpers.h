/**
   This class basically responds to the bumpers the robot has, what
   the activity things the robot has is decided by the param file.  If
   the robot is going forwards and bumps into something with the front
   bumpers, it will back up and turn.  If the robot is going backwards
   and bumps into something with the rear bumpers then the robot will
   move forward and turn.
