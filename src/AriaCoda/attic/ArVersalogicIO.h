/** @brief Interface to integrated digital and analog I/O interfaces on Versalogic VSBC8 and EBX-12 Cobra computers (digital IO on 2nd * gen.  PatrolBot)
 
  This class is a basic set of calls to use the Linux device driver, <code>amrio</code>,
  which reads and writes data to VersaLogic's Opto22 and analog interfaces.
  The <code>amrio</code> driver must be built into the Linux kernel or its
  module loaded. Contact MobileRobots for information about obtaining this
  driver.
  It currently supports the Versalogic VSBC-8d, VSBC-8k, and EBX12 (Cobra) motherboards.

  The digital portion of the Opto22 consists of two banks of 8 pins on the VSBC8
  and four banks of 8 pins on the EBX12.  Each bank can be set as either inputs
  or outputs.  The banks are zero-indexed, so bank0 is the first one.

  The analog inputs require a separate chip.  There are 8 inputs, only
  one of which can be read at a time.  It currently returns a value between
  0 and 4096 or a decimal value in the range of 0-5V.  The constructor will attempt
  an analog conversion, and if it fails will assume that the chip is not present
  and will disable the analog function.

  See the motherboard manual for information about physical connections and specifications of the analog input and Opto22 digital IO.
  Computer motherboard manuals are available at http://robots.mobilerobots.com/docs .

  The SPECIAL_CONTROL_REGISTER contains a few bits of information, the one of
  importance at the moment is the CPU_OVERTEMPERATURE bit, which will be set
  high if the CPU temp is over the warning temp as set in the BIOS.  Bitwise
  AND the special_control_register output with 0x20 to find the temperature
  bit.

  The destructor closes the device, so just delete the ArVersalogicIO instance
  to close the device.
