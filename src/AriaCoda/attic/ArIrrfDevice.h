/// A class for connecting to a PB-9 and managing the resulting data
/**
   This class is for use with a PB9 IR rangefinder.  It has the packethandler
   necessary to process the packets, and will put the data into ArRangeBuffers
   for use with obstacle avoidance, etc.

   The PB9 is still under development, and only works on an H8 controller
   running AROS.
