// Code is for the Mode Selector box
//

To compile and upload to the start box, run the following command in this folder:
./flash

When coding, write /dev/mode_selector_box to access the right usbport of the box. This is set by the udev rules that you can read about in the wiki on git. 

There are two places you might have to change the USB-port if the udev rules are changed:
- the make-file
- start.py
