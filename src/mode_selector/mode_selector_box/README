To compile and upload to the start box, run the following command in this folder:
./flash

If that does not work you probably need to change the port number in the make file.
On the Cyborg it should be /dev/ttyUSB12
Use "ls /dev/ttyUSB*" before and after removing the Start Box to find which port is correct.
