# CyborgRobot
The NTNU Cyborg Robot repo

## Starting with the repo ##
1. create a catkin workspace 
2. clone this repo into the workspace
3. go into the folder named CyborgRobot (this repo) and show any hidden files
4. move ALL files and folders, including any hidden ones, to the catkin_ws (meaning just outside of CyborgRobot)
You should now be abele to use the workspace and git without any problems.
